Summary:
This coding challenge familiarized me with unix command line tools and using the sys library in python
to handle command line arguments

Lessons:
1. Handle standard input and file input in separate functions
2. sys.argv gets command line arguments as an array
3. sys.stdin.read() gets standard input
4. Throw error or "usage -** **" when the command is not properly formatted
5. A locale is a collection of settings for the user's environment, such as language, country/region, and script.
   The user's locale allows the operating system or applications to use the appropriate conventions such as sort order;
   keyboard layout; and date, time, number, and currency formats.
